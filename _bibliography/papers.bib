  abstract={To fit sparse linear associations, a LASSO sparsity inducing penalty with a single hyperparameter provably allows to recover the important features (needles) with high probability in certain regimes even if the sample size is smaller than the dimension of the input vector (haystack). More recently learners known as artificial neural networks (ANN) have shown great successes in many machine learning tasks, in particular fitting nonlinear associations. Small learning rate, stochastic gradient descent algorithm and large training set help to cope with the explosion in the number of parameters present in deep neural networks. Yet few ANN learners have been developed and studied to find needles in nonlinear haystacks. Driven by a single hyperparameter, our ANN learner, like for sparse linear associations, exhibits a phase transition in the probability of retrieving the needles, which we do not observe with other ANN learners. To select our penalty parameter, we generalize the universal threshold of Donoho and Johnstone (Biometrika 81(3):425â€“455, 1994) which is a better rule than the conservative (too many false detections) and expensive cross-validation. In the spirit of simulated annealing, we propose a warm-start sparsity inducing algorithm to solve the high-dimensional, non-convex and non-differentiable optimization problem. We perform simulated and real data Monte Carlo experiments to quantify the effectiveness of our approach.},

    abstract={In this paper we develop a general approach to dimer models analogous to Krichever's scheme in the theory of integrable systems. 
      We start with a Riemann surface and the simplest generic meromorphic functions on it and demonstrate how to obtain integrable dimer models.
      These are dimer models on doubly periodic bipartite graphs with quasi-periodic positive weights.
      Dimer models with periodic weights and Harnack curves are recovered as a special case.
      This generalization from Harnack curves to general M-curves leads to transparent algebro-geometric structures.
      In particular explicit formulas for the Ronkin function and surface tension as integrals of meromorphic differentials on M-curves are obtained. Furthermore we describe the variational principle for the height function in the quasi-periodic case.
      Based on Schottky uniformizations of Riemann surfaces we present concrete computational results including computing the weights and sampling dimer configurations with them.
      The computational results are in complete agreement with the theoretical predictions.},
